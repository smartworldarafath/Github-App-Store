  RepoStore is a GitHub-powered Android app store that discovers repositories shipping real installable APKs and lets you install, track, and update them from one place.

> [!CAUTION]
> Free and Open-Source Android is under threat. Google will turn Android into a locked-down platform, restricting your essential freedom to install apps of your choice. Make your voice heard – [keepandroidopen.org](https://keepandroidopen.org/).

## ❓ How does an app appear in RepoStore?

RepoStore does not use any private indexing or manual curation. Your project can appear automatically if it follows these conditions:

1. **Public repository on GitHub**
   - Visibility must be `public`.

2. **At least one published release**
   - Created via GitHub Releases (not only tags).
   - The latest release must not be a draft or prerelease.

3. **APK assets in the latest release**
   - The latest release must contain at least one `.apk` file.
   - GitHub's auto-generated source artifacts are ignored.

4. **Discoverable by search / topics**
   - Repositories are fetched via the public GitHub Search API.
   - Topics like `android`, `mobile`, `apk` help ranking.
   - Having stars makes it more likely to appear in sections.

If your repo meets these conditions, RepoStore can find it through search and show it automatically—no manual submission required.

## 🧭 How RepoStore Works

1. **Search**
   - Uses GitHub's `/search/repositories` endpoint with Android-focused queries.
   - Applies scoring based on topics, language, and description.
   - Filters out archived repos.

2. **Release + Asset Check**
   - For candidate repos, calls `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`.
   - Checks the `assets` array for `.apk` files.
   - If no APK is found, the repo is excluded from results.

3. **Details Screen**
   - Repository info: name, owner, description, stars, forks.
   - Latest release: tag, published date, changelog, assets.
   - README: loaded and rendered as "About this app".
   - Screenshots: detected from repository contents.

4. **Install Flow**
   - When user taps "Install":
     - Downloads the APK with progress indicator.
     - Delegates to the system package installer.
     - Records installation in local database.
     - Shows "Open" button for installed apps.
